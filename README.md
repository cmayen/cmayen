# 👋 Hey there, I'm Chris Mayenschein

#### DevOps • Linux SysAdmin • Robotics & Automation Engineer • Creative Technologist

🚀 I bridge software and hardware through **automation, robotics, and open-source engineering**.  
With  experience spanning **Linux infrastructure, solar systems, embedded hardware, and DevOps**, I thrive on solving real-world problems through code, circuits, and a bit of caffeine.

### ⚙️ What I Build

- **Kubernetes HomeLabs** – because cloud-native shouldn’t be limited to the cloud.
- **Automation Tools** – from robots to routers, I script everything I can.
- **IoT + Electronics Projects** – blending physical computing with smart software.
- **Open Source Experiments** – check out [ClusterShed](https://github.com/clustershed) for more polished releases.

### 🧠 Currently Exploring

- Smarter DevOps workflows with AI assistance
- Lightweight observability in home and edge clusters
- Integrating robotics control with GitOps-style deployments

### 🧩 A Bit About Me

> “If it runs on code, circuits, or caffeine… I’ve probably worked on it.”

When I’m not tuning a cluster or wiring up a sensor, I’m likely designing new automation concepts, creating content at **[ClusterShed](https://github.com/clustershed)**, or exploring robotics hardware.
