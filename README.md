## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub, a place with a bunch of random things, or something like that.


My current sandbox project "paila" uses LLM/AI to review and report on linux system logs. It's a spare time prototype and initial code may be ugly. :)

Check out this page for my notes on the very first prototype test.
[Ubuntu, Docker, and Ollama on AMD to analyze logs.](https://cmayen.github.io/pages/ubuntu-docker-ollama-rocm-log-analyzer) <!-- {:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} -->

I'm a hands on technology guy bridging the gap between hardware and software from robotic automation and network pipelines to solar installs and Linux system administration. With a background spanning from early internet infrastructure to modern cloud native tooling, Iâ€™ve always thrived in roles where creative problem solving meets real world impact through learning new technologies and switching contexts quickly. Whether installing robotic cells or coding server automation, I bring curiosity, reliability, and grit to every team I join. If it runs on code, circuits, or caffeine..... Iâ€™ve probably worked on it.
